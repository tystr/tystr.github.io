## What is BDD?

BDD stands for behavior-driven development. It differs from TDD (test-driven development) in that

a modal dialog containing some specific text instead of writing code that fulfulls a specific assertion, such as
when I call this function with these values I expected to get this result.

## Why follow BDD?
 * Bridge the gap between stakeholders and developers
 * End-to-end coverage
 * Ubiquitous language


## How to BDD (with php)?

 * Add feature
 * Add Scenario
 * Write Steps
   * Given
   * When
   * Then
 * Implement Steps
 * Profit!




The question you should ask anytime you hear of a new process or new tool, is "why should I invest time in learning
or implementing this?". I am going to explain how behavior-driven development can improve your development process by
streamlining collaboration between 2 entities--steakholders and engineers.

BDD really can excel in focusing teams on working toward the bigger picture rather than the
smaller implementations. BDD helps to bridge the gap between the steakholders, the ones requesting a specific feature
or change, and the developers. If a steakholder approaches an engineer and asks for a report to be sorted and searchable,
the engineer may respond with "Ok, lemme start hacking away at this. I'll have it done by the end of the day."

When the steakholder receives the end result, it could be nothing at all like his or her vision. By setting forth
