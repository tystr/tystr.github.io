Engineers like to build things. They like to hack on something that's broken
until it's fixed, or fiddle with some new technology until they've built
something new and interesting.

Engineers like to tinker, utilizing their freedom (when given) to explore new
ways to accomplish things.

Engineers like to discover--new languages, new technologies, new schools of
thought.

In a small team, it's easy to run engineering with these things as the crux of
the engineering culture. But with a large engineering organization, where teams
are much more diverse--analyzing data, building data modeling tools, automating
processes, etc.--it becomes much more difficult to maintain that focus. It's
not nearly as obvious that each engineering team is working towards something
bigger (if they are).

So how do we solve this?

I've solved this with something I've come to refer to as "Product focused
engineering". Now, as much as that sounds like a fluffy catch-phrase, hear me
out.

...

Product focused engineering means you are always working towards a goal, a
product. This could be an MVP that takes a couple of weeks to put together,
or it can be a massive product that will take a dozen engineers 12 months
or so to complete. But the key part is that engineers are building a
product--some application that is going to be used by some end-user.
